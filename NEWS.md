# NEWS

This document keeps track of breaking changes and what you can do if you update and things don't work anymore.

Notes are in reverse chronological order.

### v0.6+ (new functionalities)

* Multiline markdown definitions are now allowed, the lines **must** be indented with four spaces e.g. this is ok:

```
@def x = begin
    z = [1,2,3]
    z .+ 3
    end
```

which is a convoluted way of writing

```
@def x = [4,5,6]
```

* template for loop is now available so that you can do this:

```
{{for e in x}}
  {{fill e}}
{{end}}
```

which with the definition above would show `4 5 6` on separate lines.

### v0.6

The most important change is a complete re-vamp of the folder structure resulting from issue #335.

TL;DR: _I just want to keep stuff as they were..._, just add a single line to your `config.md`:

```markdown
@def folder_structure = v"0.1"
```

things should _just work_, and if they don't please open an issue.

Now if you want to migrate your site: the "old" folder structure was essentially:

```
.
├── assets
├── css
├── libs
├── pub
└── src
    ├── _css
    ├── _html_parts
    ├── config.md
    ├── index.md
    ├── pages
    └── search.md
```

where the "new" folder structure is now:

```
.
├── __site
├── _assets
├── _css
├── _layout
├── _libs
├── config.md
├── index.md
├── pages
└── search.md
```

where `__site` will contain the full generated site. To migrate from old to new:

1. move `assets` to `_assets`
1. move `src/_css` to `_css`
1. move `src/_html_parts` to `_layout`
1. move `libs` to `_libs`
1. move the rest of the content of `src/` up one level
1. optionally move the content of `pages/` up one level (1)
1. remove `pub/` and `css/`

(1): since the `pub` disappears, there's also no need for the `pages/` folder but you can keep it if you like.

Then you may have to:

- fix links in `_layout/head.html` removing `/pub/` and `.html` so for instance `/pub/menu1.html` becomes `/menu1/`, relative links **must start and end with a `/`**,
- fix a few of your internal links (use `verify_links()` to help you with that),
- set things up so that the content of  `__site` is what's served on GitHub or elsewhere.
- **Note**: links to stylesheets should still be ok, even though the source is now in `_css`, this gets mapped to `__site/css/` and so `/css/somesheet.css` will still work fine.

In terms of understanding how the generated paths look, consider the following mappings:

```
`/index.md`         -->     `__site/index.html`
`/index.html`       -->     `__site/index.html`
`/menu1.md`         -->     `__site/menu1/index.html`
`/folder/index.md`  -->     `__site/folder/index.html`
`/folder/page.md`   -->     `__site/folder/page/index.html`
```

This allows to have urls like `www.site.ext/menu1/`.

Finally note that the deployment of the `__site/` folder is now automated, but to get there you need to set up your repository properly, see the [docs on how to do this](https://franklinjl.org/workflow/deploy/).

**If you encounter issues during the process, open an issue on  GitHub or ask on Slack, I'll try to help and improve these instructions at the same time, thanks!**

### v0.5 (JuDoc -> Frankin)
