"""
$(SIGNATURES)

Internal function to parse a relative path and return either a path relative
to the website root folder or the website assets folder or a full system path.
This doesn't check whether the  path points to  an existing asset (for that
see [`resolve_rpath`](@ref).

* `/[path]`:  this is a path relative to the website root folder, e.g.:
              `/foo/figs/img1.png`.
* `./[path]`: this is a path relative to the assets folder with the same path
              as the calling page.
              For instance, `./im1.png` in `src/pages/pg1.md` will point to
              `/assets/pages/pg1/im1.png`

Otherwise, if in `code` mode, recurse with `./code/path`, otherwise consider
the given path as a full path relative to the `/assets/` folder.

## Argument

1. `rpath`: the relative path (always in Unix format)

## Keywords

* `canonical=false`: whether to return a full path on the system (`true`) or
                     a unix-path relative to the website root folder (`false`).
* `code=false`:      whether we're in a code context or not (in which case an
                     additional shortcut form is allowed).

given a relative path (in unix format) and return a tuple with:

adequate extension or, failing that, will try to find anything that matches
