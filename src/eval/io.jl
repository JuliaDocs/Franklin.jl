"""
$(SIGNATURES)

Internal function to parse a relative path and return either a path relative
to the website root folder or the website assets folder or a full system path.
This doesn't check whether the  path points to  an existing asset (for that
see [`resolve_rpath`](@ref).

* `/[path]`:  this is a path relative to the website root folder, e.g.:
              `/foo/figs/img1.png`.
* `[path]`:   this is a path relative to the site assets folder, e.g.:
              `/assets/foo`.
* `./[path]`: this is a path relative to the assets folder with the same path
              as the calling page. For instance, `./im1.png` in
              `src/pages/pg1.md` will point to `/assets/pages/pg1/im1.png`.

Otherwise, if in `code` mode, recurse with `./code/path`.

## Argument

1. `rpath`: the relative path (always in Unix format)

## Keywords

* `canonical=false`: whether to return a full path on the system (`true`) or
                     a unix-path relative to the website root folder (`false`).
* `code=false`:      whether we're in a code context or not (in which case an
                     additional shortcut form is allowed).
