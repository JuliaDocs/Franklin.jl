# TODO: could also expose the channel options if someone wanted
# to define those; can probably leave for later until feedback has
# been received.

# Specifications: RSS 2.0 -- https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#sampleFiles
# steps:
# 0. check if the relevant variables are defined otherwise don't generate the RSS
# 1. is there an RSS file?
#  --> remove it and create a new one (bc items may have been updated)
# 2. go over all pages
#  --> is there a rss var?
#  NO  --> skip
#  YES --> recuperate the `jd_ctime` and `jd_mtime` and add a RSS channel object
# 3. save the file
