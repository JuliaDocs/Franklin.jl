## Overview

The general syntax to define a page variable is to write `@def varname = value` on a new line e.g.:

```
@def author = "Septimia Zenobia"
```

where you could set the variable to a string, a number, a date,... anything. Definitions can span multiple lines but if they do, the subsequent lines **must** be indented e.g.:

```
@def some_str = """A string
    on several lines is ok
    but lines must be indented"""
```

These variables can serve multiple purposes but, primarily, they can be accessed from the HTML template blocks e.g.:

```html
<footer>
  This is the footer. &copy; {{fill author}}.
</footer>
```

which could be useful as footer on all pages.

The syntax `{{ ... }}` indicates a HTML _function_, `fill` is the function name and the rest of the bracket elements are _page variables_ (here `author`) serving as arguments of the function.

_Local_ page variables denote variables that are defined on a single page and accessible on that page only by contrast to _global_ page variables which are set globally (in the `config.md` file) and accessible on all pages.

In both cases there are _default_ page variables with default values which you can change and use.
You can also define your own variables, both global and local.

### Using page variables

Both local and global page variables are meant for essentially two purposes:

@@tlist
1. control the HTML template from the markdown,
1. modify how Franklin generates HTML.
@@

The second one is a bit less prevalent but, for instance, you can specify the default programming language for all code blocks so that code blocks that don't specify a language would use the default language for highlighting:

```
@def lang = "julia"
```

In the first case, you can access variables in your HTML template via one of the HTML functions such as the `fill` function shown above.

## HTML functions

HTML functions can be used in any one of your `*.html` file and in particular in any of the `_layout/*.html` files such as `head.html`.
They are always called with the syntax `{{fname pv1 pv2 ...}}` where `pv1 pv2 ...` are page variable names.

### Basic functions

A few functions are available with the `{{fill ...}}` arguably the most likely to be of use.

@@lalign
| Format | Role |
| :----: | :--: |
| `{{fill vname}}` or `{{vname}}` | place the value of page variable `vname`
| `{{fill vname rpath}}` | same but taking the value from the page at `rpath` where `rpath` is a relative path like `blog/pg1`
| `{{insert fpath}}` | insert the content of the file at `fpath`
| `{{href  vname}}` | inserts a reference (_mostly internal use_)
| `{{toc}}` | places a table of content (_mostly internal use_)
@@

The `{{insert fpath}}` can be useful if you want to include specific HTML scaffolding on some pages, for instance in example pages you will see in the `head.html`:

```html
{{if hasmath}} {{insert head_katex.html}} {{end}}
```

### Conditional blocks

Conditional blocks allow to specify which parts of the HTML template should be active depending on the value of given page variable(s).
The format follows this structure:

```html
{{if vname}}
...
{{elseif vname2}}
...
{{else}}
...
{{end}}
```

where `vname` and `vname2` are expected to be page variable evaluating to a boolean.
Of course you don't have to specify the `{{elseif ...}}` or `{{else}}` if you don't need them.

\note{
  The conditional blocks are fairly basic; in particular operations between page variables are not supported, so you can't write something like `{{if hasmath && hascode}}`.
  For more complex use cases, consider defining your own HTML functions using the [utils file](/syntax/utils/).
}

You can also use some dedicated conditional blocks:

@@lalign
| Format | Role |
| :----: | :--: |
| `{{ispage path/to/page}}` | whether the current page corresponds to the path
| `{{isnotpage path/to/page}}` | opposite of previous
| `{{isdef vname}}` | whether `vname` is defined
| `{{isnotdef vname}}` | opposite of previous
@@

The `{{ispage ...}}` and `{{isnotpage ...}}` accept `*` as joker symbol; for instance `{{ispage maths/*}}` is allowed.

**Note**: for the `C` users out there, you can also use `ifdef`, `ifndef`.

Consider the following example (very similar to what is used on the current page):

```html
<li class="{{ispage syntax/*}}active{{end}}">â€¢ Syntax
<ul>
  <!-- ... -->
  <li class="{{ispage syntax/page-variables}}active{{end}}">Page Variables
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>
```

This allows a simple, javascript-free, way of having a navigation menu that is styled depending on which page is currently active.

### For loops

You can define iterable page variables (array, tuple, ...) and loop over them using the following syntax:

```html
{{for x in vname}}
  ...{{fill x}}...
{{end}}
```

Only `{{fill vname}}` and `{{fill vname rpath}}` are allowed in such a for loop. You can also unpack an iterable like

```html
{{for (x, y) in vname}}
  ...{{fill x}}...{{fill y}}
{{end}}
```

where `vname` would refer to something like `[(1,2),(3,4)]`.

## Global page variables

The table below list global page variables that you can set.
These variables are best defined in your `config.md` file though you can overwrite the value locally by redefining the variable on a given page (this will then only have an effect on that page).

## Local page variables

The tables below list local page variables that you can set.
These variables are typically set locally on a page.
Remember that:
@@tlist
- you can also define your own variables (with different names),
- you can change the default value of a variable by defining it in your `config.md`.

Note that variables shown below that have a  name starting with  `fd_` are _not meant to be defined_ as their value is  typically  computed  on the fly (but they can be used).

### RSS

These are variables related to [RSS 2.0 specifications](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html)  and must match the format indicated there.
If you want proper RSS to be generated, you **must** define at least the `rss_description` or `rss` (which is an alias for `rss_description`).
All these variables expect a `String`.

| Name | Default value |
| ---- | ------------- |

| `rss_enclosure` | `""` |

To recapitulate, for a working RSS feed to be generated you need:

@@tlist
- to set the `website_*` variables in your  `config.md` (see [global page variables](#global_page_variables)),
- on appropriate pages, to define at least `rss` to a valid description.
