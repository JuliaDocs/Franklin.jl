# Extras

In this section of the manual, the assumption is that you already have a fairly good idea of how Franklin works so basic explanations are skipped (refer to the rest of the  manual for help).

The aim is to show how Franklin can work with other useful libraries to add functionalities to your website.
See also the [demos](/demos/).

As usual, these examples are just meant to show what can be done, not the best way to do it, feel free to modify the examples at will!
Also, if you come up with other nice ways of extending Franklin, don't hesitate to make a suggestion for an example to be added here.
